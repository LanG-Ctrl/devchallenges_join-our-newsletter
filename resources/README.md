## Overview

This project was created to fulfill the "Join Our Newsletter" challenge by **devChallenges.io**. The goal was to create a responsive form that allows users to subscribe to a newsletter. It includes an email input field and a "Subscribe" button, as well as some informative text about email confidentiality.

### What I learned

Through this project, I improved my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **responsive design**. Some of the key concepts I focused on include:

- **Responsive Design**: I used **media queries** to ensure the layout adapts well to smaller screen sizes, like phones and tablets.
- **Form Elements**: I learned how to style input fields and buttons, ensuring a clean and functional layout for forms.
- **Typography**: I applied custom fonts to enhance the visual appearance of text elements.

I also used some custom CSS properties like box-shadow, padding, and margin for styling the container and the form elements.

### Useful resources

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes, from large desktops to small mobile phones.
